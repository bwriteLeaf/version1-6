[subsection]吸烟
{{year}}年度{{city}}参检女性的平均吸烟率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and smoking_A=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}/{{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and smoking_A is not null and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}*100}}%，而参检男性的平均吸烟率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and smoking=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}/{{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and smoking is not null and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}*100}}%，其中参检女性吸烟率排名前三位的地区分别为{{call=getTopk(['smoking_A=1'], ['smoking_A is not null'], [], 'exam', 'district', 'texts', 3, {{year}})}}；参检男性吸烟率排名前三位的是{{call=getTopk(['smoking=1'], ['smoking is not null'], [], 'exam', 'district', 'texts', 3, {{year}})}}。尽管参检女性本人吸烟率较低，但妇女被动吸烟比例较高。数据分析结果显示参检女性被动吸烟的比例为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and (second_hand_smoking_A=1 or second_hand_smoking_A=2) and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}/{{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and second_hand_smoking_A is not null and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}*100}}%，其中大部分为偶尔被动吸烟，其中{{call=getTopk(['second_hand_smoking_A=1 or second_hand_smoking_A=2'], [''], [], 'exam', 'district', 'texts', 2, {{year}})}}经常被动吸烟的女性较多。参检男性被动吸烟的比例比女性【略高】，全市平均{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and (second_hand_smoking=1 or second_hand_smoking=2) and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}/{{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and second_hand_smoking is not null and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}*100}}%，，其中大部分为偶尔被动吸烟，比例为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and (second_hand_smoking=1) and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}/{{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and second_hand_smoking is not null and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}*100}}%，经常被动吸烟比例为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and (second_hand_smoking=2) and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}/{{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and second_hand_smoking is not null and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31'}}*100}}%，经常被动吸烟的男性以{{call=getTopk(['second_hand_smoking=1 or second_hand_smoking=2'], [''], [], 'exam', 'district', 'texts', 2, {{year}})}}最多。
