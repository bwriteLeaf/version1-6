[chapter]慢病风险因素
慢性病的风险评估主要通过参检夫妇自报是否患有或曾经患有各种慢性疾病，测量血压、血糖、肝功能（谷丙转氨酶，ALT）、肾功能（肌酐，Cr）及甲状腺功能（促甲状腺激素，TSH）等临床实验室指标来识别是否患有可能增加出生缺陷等不良妊娠结局发生风险的慢性疾病。
[section]慢性病自报患病情况
孕前健康检查询问了参检夫妇是否患有或曾经患过下列七种主要慢性非传染性疾病：高血压、心脏病、糖尿病、癫痫、甲状腺疾病、慢性肾炎、肿瘤。
在女方参检对象中，自报患有或曾经患有至少一种上述慢性病的比例（简称自报患病率）为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where (hypertension_A=1 or heart_disease_A=1 or diabetes_A=1 or epilepsy_A=1 or thyroid_disease_A=1 or chronic_nephritis_A=1 or swelling_A=1) }} / {{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where is_ill_A is not null}} * 100}}%。男方参检对象中，自报慢性病患病率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where (hypertension=1 or heart_disease=1 or diabetes=1 or epilepsy=1 or thyroid_disease=1 or chronic_nephritis=1 or swelling=1)}} / {{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where is_ill is not null}} * 100}}%。{{year}}年深圳市各地区女方及男方自报慢性病患病情况如下图、表所示。其中，女方自报慢病患病率顺位前三名的地区分别为【{{sql:(3,1)=select left(service_code, 6) as city,count(*) as x from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where (hypertension_A=1 or heart_disease_A=1 or diabetes_A=1 or epilepsy_A=1 or thyroid_disease_A=1 or chronic_nephritis_A=1 or swelling_A=1) group by city order by x desc}}】，其自报慢病患病率分别为5.81%、4.57%及4.41%；【待实现】男方自报慢病患病率顺位前三名的地区分别为【{{sql:(3,1)=select left(service_code, 6) as city,count(*) as x from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where (hypertension=1 or heart_disease=1 or diabetes=1 or epilepsy=1 or thyroid_disease=1 or chronic_nephritis=1 or swelling=1) group by city order by x desc}}】，其自报慢病患病率分别为4.83%、3.84%及3.76%。【待实现】

谷丙转氨酶（ALT）升高提示肝细胞损伤，根据ALT检测结果，ALT>45U/L界定为肝功能异常 。按照此标准，结果显示女方参检对象肝功能异常率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where alt_A>45}}/ {{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where alt_A is not null}}}}%，男方参检对象肝功能异常率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where alt>45}}/ {{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where alt is not null}}}}%。男方参检对象肝功能异常率明显高于女方。女方肝功能异常率顺位前三位的分别为【{{sql:(3,1)=select left(service_code,6) as city, count(*) as x from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where alt_A>45 group by city order by x desc}}】，检出率分别为3.46%、3.44%和3.12%；【未实现】男方肝功能异常率顺位前三位的分别为【{{sql:(3,1)=select left(service_code,6) as city, count(*) as x from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where alt>4.5 group by city order by x desc}}】，检出率分别为23.23%、20.47%和19.71%。
 
与{{year-1}}年相比，{{year}}年女性肝功能筛查异常率坪山新区、龙岗区、宝安区有明显减少，南山区、大鹏新区、罗湖区、福田区男女方肝功能异常率比去年有所升高。详见{{year-1}}与{{year}}年男女性肝功能筛查异常率比较图。
 
[subsection]肌酐检测与肾功能异常
根据Cr检测结果，女方Cr >73μmol/L或者Cr <41μmol/L界定为肾功能异常，男方Cr >97μmol/L或者Cr <57μmol/L界定为肾功能异常 。按此界定，女方参检对象肾功能异常率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where cr_A > 73 or cr_A<41}}/ {{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where cr_A is not null}}}}%，男方参检对象肾功能异常率为{{expr:float={{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where cr > 97 or cr<57}}/ {{sql:(1,1)=select count(*) from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where cr is not null}}}}%，女方参检对象肾功能异常率明显低于男方。女方肾功能异常率顺位前三位的分别为【{{sql:(3,1)=select left(service_code,6) as city, count(*) as x from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where cr_A > 73 or cr_A<41 group by city order by x desc}}】，检出率分别为28.18%、10.74%和8.97%；【未实现】男方肾功能异常率顺位前三位的分别为【{{sql:(3,1)=select left(service_code,6) as city, count(*) as x from (select * from exam where service_code like '{{service_code}}%' and complete=1 and service_time between '{{year}}-01-01' and '{{year}}-12-31') as bt where cr>97 or cr<57 group by city order by x desc}}】，检出率分别为53.67%、18.41%和16.01%。【未实现】与{{year-1}}年相比，宝安区、罗湖区、南山区和龙华区女性和男性的肾功能异常率明显降低，但福田区的女性和男性肾功能异常率却比去年有明显上升。{{year}}年和{{year-1}}年肾功能异常率比较结果如下图所示。
